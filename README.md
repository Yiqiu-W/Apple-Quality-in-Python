The project is Sweet Insights: A Statistical Exploration of Apple Quality Using Python.

In this project, we will use dataset “Apple Quality” from Kaggle. The dataset contains 9 columns covering the attributes of apples:

-A_id: Unique identifier for each fruit

-Size: Size of the fruit

-Weight: Weight of the fruit

-Sweetness: Degree of sweetness of the fruit

-Crunchiness: Texture indicating the crunchiness of the fruit

-Juiciness: Level of juiciness of the fruit

-Ripeness: Stage of ripeness of the fruit

-Acidity: Acidity level of the fruit

-Quality: Overall quality of the fruit

We will use various Python libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy.stats etc. to answer questions like what makes “good” apples using tables and graphs.
